# Trackgenix SA
The following project is the HTML and CSS structure of the landing page of "Trackgenix SA". Trackgenix SA provides software development services to other companies. "Trackgenix" is a web system whose objective is to facilitate the registration of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team.
The proyect was saved in the main folder "BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1". Inside this folder, another named "Semana-0X" was saved. In the last folder is where the index.html file was made. Open the file "index.html" on your browser.

## Week 02
HTML5 basic structure was first placed in this project. Then, inside the "body" the "main" was settled with all the components of the website on it. The class "menu" is the first class section, this is were the sidebar menu was placed and we can find inside the "searchbar" and the "log in" and "sign up" buttons.
The following section is the id "trackgenixsa" where the first and only "h1" was placed. In this section we have 2 contents with differents titles, paragraphs, images and buttons. The third one is Features which has an "h2" title, a paragraph and an unorderer list with.

## Week 03
We implemented the CSS to the HTML file. This design has to be as close as possible to the original "figma" without using flexbox. So, we must use different CSS properties except flexbox.

## Week 04
We made the mobile first version of the landing page with flexbox. I created the different files .css with the main properties inside each of them. The reset.css was created to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, etc. In the styles.css file you can found the general properties of the landing page and also the media queries. Then I added the others .css files to change the layout of each part of my HTML page. I'm talking about the header, the sidebar, the footer, and the main who contains all the properties related to the main contain of the landing page.
All the css was made with display:flex property in order to have a more effective responsive design.

## Week 05
We have to made the JavaScript exercises in differents folders saved in our repository. Each of the .js files are in the "exercises" folder into the "Semana-05" main folder. All of our JavaScript files have to be linked to the "index.html" file via the "script" tag on the "head". In this folder 6 files was created: variables and operators, strings, arrays, if else, for and functions. Each file has different exercises and we had to use the language correctly to get a good result. Also, we had to correct the errors of the "Semana-04" exercise.

## Week 06
We have to create the html and css files of the Login and the Sign Up of our project. In those files we have to validate the data entry in the corresponding files. Also we have to add the events "blur" and "focus" in all of the inputs. In case you submit successfully the form a window with the message "Successfully registered" or "Has login successfully" will appears.
